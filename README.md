# ComputerArchitecture
Design an instruction set and overall architecture (ISA) for a special-purpose reduced instruction set (RISC) processor. Design the hardware for the processor core.

(Credits to Prof. John Eldon)

- Design the instruction set and overall architecture (ISA) for your own special-purpose reduced instruction set (RISC) processor. Including:
  - Instruction set
  - Instruction format
  - Register amount (general-purpose or specialized?)
  - Addressing modes supported 
  - Constraints:
    - All internal data paths and storage will be 8 bits wide 
    - Conventional main memory of 256 bytes (8-bit address pointer)
- Your desgin should be optimized for three simple programs.
  - Program 1: Encry

- Design the hardware for your processor core.
- Design the assembler.
